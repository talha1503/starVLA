"""Ghost-trail image patching for RL-games frames.

Builds a single composite image where the most recent frame is the
authoritative background (always correct), and up to N earlier frames
contribute fading "ghost" cutouts of a tracked object at its past on-screen
positions -- giving a model implicit access to recent motion/velocity that a
single frame can't show.

The core functions (`select_ghost_frames`, `build_ghost_trail_image`) are
game-agnostic: pass a `segment_fn` that extracts the object to trail, and
(optionally) an `occlusion_fn` plus `steps`/`scroll_px_per_step` for games
where the camera follows the object and the background scrolls.

Flappy Bird (the first game this was built for) needs both extras: its world
scrolls (pipes move left over time) while the bird stays at a roughly fixed
screen x, so a ghost's old (x, y) position can be occluded by a pipe that has
since scrolled into that exact spot, and on-screen position alone
understates the bird's true motion through the level. Ghosts are clipped to
the *current* frame's pipe/ground mask before compositing (recomputed fresh
every time, so it stays correct for every timestep, not just frames where
the background happens to be unchanged) and shifted by the measured scroll
rate to reproject them into the current frame's reference.

Demon Attack (static camera, no scroll) needs neither: on-screen position
already is the true motion, and there's nothing that should occlude the
trail, so it can use `occlusion_fn=None` and omit `steps`.
